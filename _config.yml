# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: "Hi, there! I am Jinpei Guo, a fourth-year undergraduate student in Computer Science and Technology at Shanghai Jiao
Tong University. 

I worked closely with Prof. Junchi Yan as a research assistant at SJTU-ReThinkLab, during which we focused on 
machine learning for combinatorial optimization. I also did research with Prof. Xujie Si at the University of Toronto on neural logical reasoning. We 
developed a reliable and interpretable framework to capture the rules of logical puzzles in conjunctive normal form explicitly. We also conducted research on SAT solving, especially with GNNs.
